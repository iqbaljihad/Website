>“I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.”
- - -

>If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they would become aware only after most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they’ve forgotten how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment.
- - -

>he had wanted to know the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man’s sins.
- - -

>When someone sees the same people every day, as had happened with him at the seminary, they wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they want the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry.
- - -

>Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.
- - -

>“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie.”
- - -

>“It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.
- - -

>“In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends.”
- - -

>“Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the same currents,”
- - -

>‘The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.’”
- - -

>One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather.”
- - -

>It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired.
- - -

>When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.
- - -

>people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.
- - -

>So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.
- - -

>‘Eat when it’s time to eat. And move along when it’s time to move along.’”
- - -

>At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him.
- - -

>Actually, it wasn’t that those things, in themselves, revealed anything at all; it was just that people, looking at what was occurring around them, could find a means of penetration to the Soul of the World.
- - -

>If you pay attention to the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be better. Forget about the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.”
- - -

>to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day. Every day was there to be lived or to mark one’s departure from this world. Everything depended on one word: “Maktub.”
- - -

>“Courage is the quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.”
- - -

>“When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream,”
- - -

>“You must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s because it wasn’t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World.”
- - -

>“One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.”
- - -

>“If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.”
- - -

>“There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answered. “It’s through action.
- - -

>“They were looking only for gold,” his companion answered. “They were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend.”
- - -

>“Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.”
- - -

>“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?” “Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you’re thinking about life and about the world.” “You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?” “Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them. “You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better to listen to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an unanticipated blow.”
- - -

>“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”
- - -

>before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way.
- - -

>“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”
- - -

>“Does a man’s heart always help him?” the boy asked the alchemist. “Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their Personal Legends. But they do help children, drunkards, and the elderly, too.”
- - -

>“Your eyes show the strength of your soul,”
- - -

>Because when we love, we always strive to become better than we are.”
