## Review
This book felt more like a tragedy than a romance novel, complete with ironic mistakes and unavoidable circumstances that made nearly all of the main characters' lives miserable.

But it was heart warming in the way it showed how good relationships can persevere in the face of tragedy and ultimately move on to a better future.
