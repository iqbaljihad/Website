# Antisocial by Andrew Marantz

>people could receive information horizontally, from their friends, rather than waiting for gatekeepers to impart it from on high;
- - -
>What I can offer is the story of how a few disruptive entrepreneurs, motivated by naïveté and reckless techno-utopianism, built powerful new systems full of unforeseen vulnerabilities, and how a motley cadre of edgelords, motivated by bigotry and bad faith and nihilism, exploited those vulnerabilities to hijack the American conversation.

>Fairbanks, Rudkowski, and Pool didn’t agree on a well-developed policy agenda. What they shared was closer to an attitude—an instinctive aversion to anything mainstream. They

>establishment wings of the Democratic and Republican parties, but their guiding principles seemed more temperamental than political. Things they liked: energy, scrappiness, rebellion. Things they disliked: institutionalism, incrementalism, the status quo. If something could be described as an emanation of the Man, then they were against it.

>could mobilize and monetize a following on social media.
- - -
>In every case, their main skill was the same: a knack for identifying resonant images and talking points, and for propelling them from the fringes of the internet into the mainstream.
- - -
>They knew that a series of small memetic victories would help them gain ground in a larger informational war.
- - -
>They took for granted that the old institutions ought to be burned to the ground,
- - -
>McInnes often asserted that conservatism was “the new punk rock,” and there was something to this, at least on the level of pure energy.
- - -
>Neutrality has never been a universal good, even in the simplest of times.
- - -
>“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” (Thiel’s answer: “Most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.”)
- - -
>Too often, what seemed like stability and consensus was actually achieved by stifling dissent, muting marginal voices, or writing off productive conflict as trivial noise.
- - -
>If history was an arc bending inexorably toward justice, then there was no need to worry about any of this—technological disruption could only lead the world more efficiently in the right direction. If history was contingent, however, then removing the gatekeepers, without any clear notion of what might replace them, could throw the whole information ecosystem into chaos.
- - -
>America was having a kind of national conversation, but too often it was reduced to a binary debate: optimistic determinism or pessimistic fatalism. What if that debate was a dead end? What if fate had nothing to do with it?
- - -
>swift flattening of all information and opinion. In the open marketplace of ideas, what was to stop a lie from outcompeting a fact?
- - -
>Just as Darwin had shown that biology proceeds not by design but by evolution, Rorty held, so might contemporary philosophy show that history is the result of

>According to Rorty, the way a society talks to itself—through books, through popular films, through schools and universities, through mass media—determines that society’s beliefs, its politics, its very culture.
- - -
>“The world does not speak,” Rorty wrote. “Only we do.” To change how we talk is to change who we are.
- - -
>We are not Good. We are not Bad. Our behavior is a product of many contingent factors, not least our cultural vocabulary, and our cultural vocabulary can change.
- - -
>They wanted to “change the world,” but they didn’t bother specifying that they wanted to change it for the better—that part was implied, and besides, it was supposed to happen more or less automatically.

>printing press and the television—by simply making communication more efficient, they led to a complete transformation of many important parts of society,” he wrote. “They encouraged progress. They changed the way society was organized. They brought us closer together.” This story wasn’t entirely wrong, but it left out a lot.
- - -
>If they thought of themselves as gatekeepers at all, they seemed to take for granted that the gates ought to be thrown wide open.
- - -
>“In the end, ‘Give the people what they want’ is a brittle and shallow civic philosophy.”
- - -
>To a techno-optimist, there was only one way the vehicle could possibly be going: forward.

>In the TV era, gatekeepers had controlled the flow of information, but at least the consumer could always change the channel.

>High-arousal posts beat low-arousal posts; the fittest content proliferated, and everything else was driven toward extinction.

>“I’m never more of a Jew than I am in a church when the organ begins.”
- - -
>If I’d had faith in the predestined arc of history—if I’d trusted that the gleaming vehicle of technology would naturally self-correct, like a driverless car, even with the rest of us asleep at the wheel—then I might have been more content to watch as the car rushed forth,

>If so, this evolution would take place by means of a “unit of cultural transmission,” which Dawkins called the meme.

>“To me, it doesn’t matter whether you’re looking at cat photos that inspire you or so-called ‘high art’ that inspires you.”

>Spartz, in his speeches, sometimes referred to himself as a “growth hacker.” In practice, though, he was more like a day trader, investing in memes that appeared to have momentum.

>Only by exposing Kony’s outrageous crimes to the rest of the American population was the meme able to grow into an epidemic.

>What if quality and popularity were sometimes correlated negatively, or not at all?

>A consumer product has to be user friendly; an art object reserves the right to be inexplicable or stubbornly useless.

>In 2008, the marketing agency Universal McCann published a report declaring that the “age of mass media” was giving way to the “age of social media.”

>Everything he did or said—everything he was—incited a sharp spike of activating emotion, positive or negative, in almost everyone. He was a ready-made viral meme.

>Facebook’s immense audience, why would a propagandist need anything else?

>“Conflict is attention” and “Attention is influence.”
- - -
>This meant that the platform overrepresented controversy,

>In a world of trending topics and algorithmic feedback loops, equal representation isn’t just impossible; it’s not even the goal.

>Trolls may be puerile, but they set an ingenious trap. By responding to their provocations, you risk amplifying their message. By ignoring them, you risk seeming complacent or complicit.

>One pattern was obvious: the more incendiary your message, and the more loudly and forcefully you repeated it,
