## PART I   THE POWER OF VALIDATION

### CHAPTER 1 WHY THIS IS WORTH YOUR TIME

 - - - 

>We want (and need) more than just a listening ear. As humans, we need to feel heard and understood. We need to feel accepted and appreciated. Good listeners, therefore, do more than just listen—they validate.

 - - - 

>Validation can make a tremendous difference in your marriage or romantic relationships. Studies show that couples who learn to validate and support each other have significantly happier and longer-lasting marriages than those who do not.

### CHAPTER 2 VALIDATION 101

 - - - 

>“Behind the need to communicate is the need to share. Behind the need to share is the need to be understood.”   – Leo Rosten

 - - - 

>Effective validation has two components:   It identifies a specific emotion It offers justification for feeling that emotion

 - - - 

>The result is simple, respectful, nonjudgmental support that helps Amy talk through and let go of her frustration rather than trying to ignore or suppress it. Their conversation becomes much more pleasant and connecting, and leads to a significantly more positive outcome.

 - - - 

>1) acknowledges a specific emotion, and 2) offers justification for feeling that emotion.

 - - - 

>Validation is nonjudgmental. It allows the other person to feel whatever they’re feeling without labeling it as “good” or “bad.”

 - - - 

>Invalidation (i.e. minimizing or dismissing another person’s feelings) is counter-productive. Research has shown that invalidating responses can make a difficult situation worse, even when offered with the best of intentions.

### CHAPTER 3 COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS

### CHAPTER 4 IT ALL STARTS WITH EMPATHY

 - - - 

>When we sympathize, we feel for someone because of his or her pain. When we empathize, we feel the pain with them.

 - - - 

>Simply look for invalidating statements. Are you telling yourself to “suck it up” or “stop worrying”? Are you trying to convince yourself that “it’s fine”? These are telltale signs that you’ve judged the emotion instead of accepting it.

 - - - 

>you can even practice validating yourself:

 - - - 

>Empathy is different from sympathy. Sympathy is standing on the outside of a situation and looking in (e.g. “I’m sorry you’re sad.”) Empathy is stepping into the situation with the other person and feeling the emotion with them (e.g. “Wow, this is sad”).

 - - - 

>Empathy Tip #1: Get curious. Ask yourself questions such as, “What is this person’s background? Could past issues be influencing their reaction? What if someone had done that to me? How would I feel? If I haven’t had a similar experience, have I ever felt a similar emotion?”

## PART II THE FOUR-STEP VALIDATION METHOD

### STEP 1 LISTEN EMPATHICALLY

 - - - 

>**Tags:** .h2

 - - - 

>“One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.”   – Bryant H. McGill

 - - - 

>This starts with listening, but also requires you to look beyond the words they speak and identify the emotions they express.

 - - - 

>Author and mediation expert Gregorio Billikopf notes that empathic listening “requires that we accompany a person in her moment of sadness, anguish, self-discovery, challenge (or even great joy!).”

 - - - 

>True, undivided attention is rare in today’s world. If you value the person you’re speaking with more than the latest sports score or a new text message, show them.

 - - - 

>You’ve let them know that you are willing to listen, which is a gift in and of itself.

 - - - 

>Matching another person’s energy is a critical part of effective validation.

 - - - 

>Micro validation is a short comment or response that affirms the validity of the other person’s emotions, opinions, etc. These quick, simple comments let the other person know that you are following what they’re saying, that you’re not judging them, and that they’re safe

 - - - 

>Micro validation lets the other person know you’re paying attention and encourages them to continue sharing.

 - - - 

>If someone is venting or sharing a negative experience, do not jump in with advice unless they ask for it.

 - - - 

>Giving unsolicited advice or assurance—especially before you validate the other person’s emotions—trivializes their experience.

### STEP 2 VALIDATE THE EMOTION

 - - - 

>Identifying a specific emotion Offering justification for feeling that emotion

 - - - 

>Claiming to know “exactly” how someone feels nearly always puts the other person on defense.

 - - - 

>The power of this kind of validation is incredible. Not only does it validate the other person’s emotions, it also demonstrates respect by not trivializing their experience.

 - - - 

>They come to realize that they can be vulnerable with us without facing judgment or pressure to fix the problem.

 - - - 

>Second, Trent didn’t do a great job—and he knows it. As a result, he’ll likely dismiss altogether any suggestion to the contrary, no matter how well-meaning.

### STEP 3 OFFER ADVICE OR ENCOURAGEMENT (IF APPROPRIATE)

 - - - 

>“Whenever you have truth it must be given with love, or the message and the messenger will be rejected.”   – Mahatma Gandhi

### STEP 4 VALIDATE AGAIN

 - - - 

>“Be generous with encouragement. It is verbal sunshine; it warms hearts, costs nothing, and enriches lives.”   – Nicky Gumbel

 - - - 

>how uncomfortable doing so can be—you show them they can confide in you without fear of judgment or dismissal.

 - - - 

>“The road to learning by precept is long, but by example, short and effective.”   – Seneca

 - - - 

>“If you want to make a difference in someone’s life, you don’t need to be gorgeous, rich, famous, brilliant, or perfect. You just have to care.”   – Karen Salmansohn

 - - - 

>When you need validation, ask for it specifically.

 - - - 

>Ignoring, dismissing, or suppressing your emotions doesn’t get rid of them; it buries them. It tucks them away to fester and arise again at a later time.

 - - - 

>When you recognize and validate your emotions instead, you strip away the judgment—the “I’m bad,” “this is wrong,” or “I shouldn’t” responses—and allow your experiences to flow through you.

 - - - 

>There will always be other opportunities and trying to “force-validate” someone may only add to their frustration.

 - - - 

>Few experiences are more fulfilling than feeling truly, deeply, and sincerely connected to another human being.

 - - - 

>everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something.

 - - - 

>being listened to—and heard—is one of the greatest desires of the human heart.
