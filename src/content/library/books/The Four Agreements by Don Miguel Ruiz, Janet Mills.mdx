>Real love is accepting other people the way they are without trying to change them.

- - -

>The best way to say, “I love you, God,” is to live your life doing your best. The best way to say, “Thank you, God,” is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment, right here and now.

- - -

>You were born with the right to be happy. You were born with the right to love, to enjoy and to share your love.

- - -

>You express your own divinity by being alive and by loving yourself and others. It is an expression of God to say, “Hey, I love you.”

- - -

>If you do your best always, over and over again, you will become a master of transformation. Practice makes the master.

- - -

>Respect your body, enjoy your body, love your body, feed, clean, and heal your body.

- - -

>Every action then becomes a ritual in which you are honoring God. After that, the next step is honoring God with every thought, every emotion, every belief, even what is “right” or “wrong.” Every thought becomes a communion with God, and you will live a dream without judgments, victimization, and free of the need to gossip and abuse yourself.

- - -

>The warrior’s goal is to transcend this world, to escape

- - -

>True freedom has to do with the human spirit — it is the freedom to be who we really are.

- - -

>Are we free to be who we really are?

- - -

>Very young children are not afraid to express what they feel. They are so loving that if they perceive love, they melt into love.

- - -

>Our normal human tendency is to enjoy life, to play, to explore, to be happy, and to love.

- - -

>What has happened is that we have the Book of Law, the big Judge and the Victim who rule our lives. We are no longer free because the Judge, the Victim, and the belief system don’t allow us to be who we really are.

- - -

>The real you is still a little child who never grew up.

- - -

>The freedom we are looking for is the freedom to be ourselves, to express ourselves. But

- - -

>The problem with most people is that they live their lives and never discover that the Judge and the Victim rule their mind, and therefore they don’t have a chance to be free.

- - -

>If you go into the dream and start challenging your beliefs, you will find that most of the beliefs that guided you into the wounded mind are not even true.

- - -

>You will find that you suffered all those years of drama for nothing. Why? Because the belief system that was put inside your mind is based on lies.

- - -

>Your life is the manifestation of your dream; it is an art. And you can change your life anytime if you aren’t enjoying the dream.

- - -

>They compare the Judge, the Victim, and the belief system to a parasite that invades the human mind. From the Toltec point of view, all humans who are domesticated are sick.

- - -

>They are sick because there is a parasite that controls the mind and controls the brain. The food for the parasite is the negative emotions that come from fear.

- - -

>That is why in all the shamanic traditions in America, from Canada to Argentina, people call themselves warriors, because they are in a war against the parasite in the mind. That is the real meaning of a warrior. The warrior is one who rebels against the invasion of the parasite.

- - -

>But to be a warrior doesn’t mean we always win the war; we may win or we may lose, but we always do our best and at least we have a chance to be free again.

- - -

>A second approach is to stop feeding the parasite. If we don’t give the parasite any food, we kill the parasite by starvation. To do this we have to gain control of our emotions, we have to refrain from fueling the emotions that come from fear.

- - -

>the awareness that the whole drama of your life is the result of what you believe, and what you believe is not real, then you can begin to change it.

- - -

>develop awareness of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy.

- - -

>Every day we awake with a certain amount of mental, emotional, and physical energy that we spend throughout the day. If we allow our emotions to deplete our energy, we have no energy to change our lives or to give to others.

- - -

>The human mind is exactly like this description of infected skin. Every human has an emotional body completely covered with infected wounds.

- - -

>Psychotic behavior occurs when the mind is so frightened and the wounds so painful, that it seems better to break contact with the outside world.

- - -

>We must forgive those we feel have wronged us, not because they deserve to be forgiven, but because we love ourselves so much we don’t want to keep paying for the injustice.

- - -

>Forgiveness is the only way to heal. We can choose to forgive because we feel compassion for ourselves. We can let go of the resentment and declare, “That’s enough! I will no longer be the big Judge that goes against myself. I will no longer beat myself up and abuse myself. I will no longer be the Victim.”

- - -

>You will know you have forgiven someone when you see them and you no longer have an emotional reaction.

- - -

>It is when we lose control that we repress the emotions, not when we are in control. The big difference between a warrior and a victim is that the victim represses, and the warrior refrains.

- - -

>Victims repress because they are afraid to show the emotions, afraid to say what they want to say. To refrain is not the same thing as repression. To refrain is to hold the emotions and to express them in the right

- - -

>The love that makes me happy is the love that I can share with you. Why do I need to deny that I love you?

- - -

>The parasite wants us to carry the past with us and that makes it so heavy to be alive. When we try to live in the past, how can we enjoy the present?

- - -

>The dream you are living is your creation. It is your perception of reality that you can change at any time. You have the power to create hell, and you have the power to create heaven.

- - -

>Imagine that you love yourself just the way you are. You love your body just the way it is, and you love your emotions just the way they are. You know that you are perfect just as you are.

- - -

>Love in action only produces happiness. Love will give you inner peace. It will change your perception of everything.

- - -

>Unfortunately, your identity is mixed with the dream of the planet. All of your beliefs and agreements are there in the fog.

- - -

>believe it is you. This makes it difficult to let go — to release the parasite and create the space to experience love. You are attached to the Judge, attached to the Victim. Suffering makes you feel safe because you know it so well.

- - -

>we have a choice: to suffer our destiny or to enjoy our destiny.
