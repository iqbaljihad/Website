“If you can change your mind, you can change your life.” ― William James


Renouvier's second Essais and see no reason why his definition of free will — 'the sustaining of a thought because I choose to when I might have other thoughts' — need be the definition of an illusion. At any rate, I will assume for the present — until next year — that it is no illusion. My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will."


But since we have free will, we can decide which thoughts we focus on. Hence, we can influence the direction of consciousness.


“You become what you think about all day long.”


Predictable Irrationality, writes: “We usually think of ourselves as sitting in the driver's seat, with ultimate control over the decisions we made and the direction our life takes; but, alas, this perception has more to do with our desires—with how we want to view ourselves-than with reality.” (emphasis mine)


John Dewey, a pragmatist, and one of the fathers of functional psychology, famously said: “The true is that which works.”


People that I know only change after a culmination of problems.


His most important idea is that we should question the source of our beliefs, not the belief itself.


Remember: The quality of our thoughts determines the quality of our lives. And our decisions are a result of our thoughts.


If you want the dots to connect in the future, you have to make sure you form dots in your brain. The only way you form dots is by learning, doing, making mistakes, reflecting, or anything you can do to feed your brain with the input it needs to give you the output you want.


Making decisions based on heuristic techniques might ease the cognitive load, but they are far from practical.


When faced with decisions, I ask myself: “Will the outcome of a decision change the way I live?”


But I can confidently say that 99% of all my thoughts in the past have been useless.


It’s better to be aware of your thoughts and decide what you will ignore, and what you will give importance to.


Only think about things you can control.


What’s a useless thought? Anything out of your control and without a useful purpose.


In the case of reflection, you’re doing something useful. But other than that, every thought about the past serves no purpose.


Commit to stop thinking about useless things. Start taking control of your mind.


The attentional bias states that our perceptions are affected by our thoughts.


There are only good-informed and bad-informed decisions.


You still can’t trust your judgments, no matter how much knowledge you have.


“The pragmatist clings to facts and concreteness, observes truth at its work in particular cases, and generalizes.”


"There are no facts, only interpretations."


Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago.”


Why do we make things so complicated while we can easily solve these things by just taking an extra day to THINK?


Training your mind happens in stages—and before you can move on to the next phase of your learning development, you have to get through a wall.


At the beginning of a new stage, things are easy to learn because everything is new. But the closer you get to the end of a stage, things get more difficult.


When I reach a wall, I know I’m close to the next stage of my development. Instead of giving up, I’m happy. All I need to do, is to take a break, rejuvenate, and let my mind recover.


When you’re in a relationship with someone who has different values, it’s a zero-sum game. One person always loses something.


Sometimes opportunities come my way and I feel like saying yes too quickly. But I have to take a step back. And ask myself: Is this really me? Very often, the answer is no. I’ve found that most things in life are not for me.


It’s good to let your attention wander and stop thinking.


You’ll find that the moments you’re not thinking are just as important as the times you are actively thinking.


conventional thinking gives you conventional results.


Instead of binary thinking, start thinking more abundantly. It’s not this or that in life. You can have this and that.


We always limit ourselves by narrow and conventional thinking. We always want to stay within a box. That’s because we never take a step back to look at the larger picture.


When you stop doing things the way they’re done, you’ll start doing things how you get it done.


There’s no use in asking why I made a mistake.


Either way, there’s no point in asking “why” when you deal with obstacles, challenges, or mistakes. Instead, think about what you can do to overcome or prevent the things that are holding you back.


“The devil is in the detail.”


Thinking about details is nothing more than doing your job.


Never underestimate or overlook details if you want to do a job right. And if you don’t, it’s better not to do it at all.


That’s exactly what I’m saying. Improve the quality of your thoughts, so you improve the quality of your actions. And always have an imbalance. Action > Thinking


When you combine a few rules, you have a system. And a system helps you to take the thinking part out of the equation.


The only thinking you need to do is when your system doesn’t give you the results you want.


regularly think about what I can change or how I can improve my systems.


you don’t regret what you did in life, you regret what you didn’t do.


this is your life and the only way you can live with yourself is to follow your strongest desires. Just make sure you think straight so you eventually act on those thoughts.


When we hold on to a lot of things in the past, they form an obstacle to living in the present.


If things don’t work out, it’s not the end of the world. Make a decision. Stand by it. Move on. And only look back to learn.


Thinking is a double-edged sword. It can help you. But it can also destroy you. The outcome depends on how you use your thoughts. Your mind is an instrument—nothing more, nothing less.


thinking by itself is useless without action.


Just sit down, be one with your thoughts, observe them, and then, ignore them. That’s all there is to meditation.


Pragmatism means that one must look at the practical value of ideas.


“We can never hope for absolute proof of anything. All our decisions are bets on what the universe is today, and what it will do tomorrow.”


William James himself once said: “The greatest use of a life is to spend it on something that will outlast it.”
