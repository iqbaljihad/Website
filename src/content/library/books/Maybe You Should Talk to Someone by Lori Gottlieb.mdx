## Review
Eh. This book was ok. I found the narrative barely interesting and the author trying too hard to draw a moral lesson and story out of the events in her life. Maybe if it was shorter?

However, what really pushed me was the therapist perspective into their clients and the terminology, of which both I'm very very interested in.

This book also had a lot of good tidbits of information and insight. It just felt weird with her trying to stuff that information into a narrative that was much less interesting.
