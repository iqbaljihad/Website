>If a stone hits a lake, however, the lake will never be the same again.

- - -

>Instead of an outer-oriented jihad—defined as “the war against infidels” and carried out by many in those days just as in the present—Rumi stood up for an inner-oriented jihad where the aim was to struggle against and ultimately prevail over one’s ego, nafs.

- - -

>My heart flailed away at my chest wall upon hearing this. “When one speaks ill of God, he speaks ill of himself,” I said.

- - -

>The Path to the Truth is a labor of the heart, not of the head. Make your heart your primary guide! Not your mind. Meet, challenge, and ultimately prevail over your nafs with your heart. Knowing your self will lead you to the knowledge of God.

- - -

>God does not take us at our word. He looks deep into our hearts. It is not the ceremonies or rituals that make a difference, but whether our hearts are sufficiently pure or not.”

- - -

>Submission is a form of peaceful acceptance of the terms of the universe, including the things we are currently unable to change or comprehend.

- - -

>one should keep the intellect satisfied and yet be careful not to spoil it.

- - -

>Don’t ever take words at face value. When you step into the zone of love, language as we know it becomes obsolete. That which cannot be put into words can only be grasped through silence.

- - -

>A Sufi is thankful not only for what he has been given but also for all that he has been denied.

- - -

>Patience does not mean to passively endure. It means to be farsighted enough to trust the end result of a process. What does patience mean? It means to look at the thorn and see the rose,

- - -

>The midwife knows that when there is no pain, the way for the baby cannot be opened and the mother cannot give birth. Likewise, for a new Self to be born, hardship is necessary. Just as clay needs to go through intense heat to become strong, Love can only be perfected in pain.

- - -

>A genuine spiritual master will not direct your attention to himself or herself and will not expect absolute obedience or utter admiration from you, but instead will help you to appreciate and admire your inner self.

- - -

>Because you are so desperate to win the approval of others, you’ll never get rid of their criticisms, no matter how hard you try.”

- - -

>“God is busy with the completion of your work, both outwardly and inwardly. He is fully occupied with you. Every human being is a work in progress that is slowly but inexorably moving toward perfection. We are each an unfinished work of art both waiting and striving to be completed. God deals with each of us separately because humanity is a fine art of skilled penmanship where every single dot is equally important for the entire picture.”

- - -

>Remember, one can only know what one is capable of loving. There is no wisdom without love. Unless we learn to love God’s creation, we can neither truly love nor truly know God.

- - -

>“Every man is an open book, each and every one of us a walking Qur’an.

- - -

>When a person knows himself or herself, he or she knows God.”

- - -

>And when we are in love we need to wait for forty days to be sure of our feelings.

- - -

>If you want to change the way others treat you, you should first change the way you treat yourself. Unless you learn to love yourself, fully and sincerely, there is no way you can be loved.

- - -

>“Fret not where the road will take you. Instead concentrate on the first step. That’s the hardest part and that’s what you are responsible for. Once you take that step let everything do what it naturally does and the rest will follow. Do not go with the flow. Be the flow.”

- - -

>Every individual is self-sufficient in his search for the divine.

- - -

>When a true lover of God goes into a tavern, the tavern becomes his chamber of prayer, but when a wine bibber goes into the same chamber, it becomes his tavern.

- - -

>In everything we do, it is our hearts that make the difference, not our outer appearances.

- - -

>Aziz was that rare type of man a woman could love without losing her self-respect.

- - -

>the greater jihad—the struggle against one’s own self.

- - -

>How can love be worthy of its name if one selects solely the pretty things and leaves out the hardships? It is easy to enjoy the good and dislike the bad. Anybody can do that. The real challenge is to love the good and the bad together,

- - -

>because you need to go beyond such descriptions and accept love in its entirety.

- - -

>Faith is only a word if there is no love at its center, so flaccid and lifeless, vague and hollow—not anything you could truly feel.

- - -

>Individual rules need to be read in the light of the whole. And the whole is concealed in the essence.

- - -

>Instead of searching for the essence of the Qur’an and embracing it as a whole,

- - -

>specific verse or two, giving priority to the divine commands that they deem to be in tune with their fearful minds.

- - -

>Hell is in the here and now. So is heaven. Quit worrying about hell or dreaming about heaven, as they are both present inside this very moment. Every time we fall in love, we ascend to heaven. Every time we hate, envy, or fight someone, we tumble straight into the fires of hell.

- - -

>Like a mirror that reflects what is absent rather than present, he shows you the void in your soul—the void you have resisted

- - -

>Layla broke into a smile. “Yes, I am Layla. But you are not Majnun,” she answered. “You have to see me with the eyes of Majnun. Otherwise you could never solve this mystery called love.”

- - -

>“The universe is one being. Everything and everyone is interconnected through an invisible web of stories. Whether we are aware of it or not, we are all in a silent conversation. Do no harm. Practice compassion. And do not gossip behind anyone’s back—not even a seemingly innocent remark!

- - -

>words that come out of our mouths do not vanish but are perpetually stored in infinite space, and they will come back to us in due time. One man’s pain will hurt us all. One man’s joy will make everyone smile,”

- - -

>But I know she did love me in her own self-centered and self-destructive way.

- - -

>The past is an interpretation. The future is an illusion. The world does not move through time as if it were a straight line, proceeding from the past to the future. Instead time moves through and within us, in endless spirals. Eternity does not mean infinite time, but simply timelessness. If you want to experience eternal illumination, put the past and the future out of your mind and remain within the present moment.

- - -

>“Your destiny is the level where you will play your tune. You might not change your instrument but how well to play is entirely in your hands.”

- - -

>“If the wine drinker Has a deep gentleness in him, He will show that, When drunk. But if he has hidden anger and arrogance, Those appear, And since most people do, Wine is forbidden to everyone.”

- - -

>That said, we cannot blame alcohol for what we are responsible for. It is our own arrogance and anger that we should be working on. That is more urgent. At the end of the day whoever wants to drink will drink and whoever wants to stay away from wine will stay away. We have no right to impose our ways on others. There is no compulsion in religion.”

- - -

>Not imams, priests, rabbis, or any other custodians of moral or religious leadership. Not spiritual masters, not even your faith. Believe in your values and your rules, but never lord them over others. If you keep breaking other people’s hearts, whatever religious duty you perform is no good.

- - -

>Learn the Truth, my friend, but be careful not to make a fetish out of your truths.”

- - -

>“The sharia is only a boat that sails in the ocean of Truth. The true seeker of God will sooner or later abandon the vessel and plunge into the sea.”

- - -

>Just like that, it is not what we aspire to achieve but the consciousness of nothingness that keeps us going.”

- - -

>Every true love and friendship is a story of unexpected transformation. If we are the same person before and after we loved, that means we haven’t loved enough.

- - -

>Submission does not mean being weak or passive. It leads to neither fatalism nor capitulation. Just the opposite. True power resides in submission—a power that comes from within. Those who submit to the divine essence of life will live in unperturbed tranquillity and peace even when the whole wide world goes through turbulence after turbulence.

- - -

>In this world, it is not similarities or regularities that take us a step forward, but blunt opposites. And all the opposites in the universe are present within each and every one of us. Therefore the believer needs to meet the unbeliever residing within.

- - -

>At every moment and with each new breath, one should be renewed and renewed again. There is only one way to be born into a new life: to die before death.”
