## I The Dynamics of Self-Esteem


### Self-Esteem in Human Life

    Summary just testing the summary

> High self-esteem can best be understood as the integrated sum of self-confidence and self-respect.

***

> High self-esteem seeks the stimulation of demanding goals.

***

> Low self-esteem typically seeks the safety of the familiar and undemanding.

***

> And if I feel lovable and deserving of respect, I treat others well and expect them to treat me well. But if I feel unlovable and undeserving of respect and I am treated poorly, I put up with it and feel it is my fate.

***

> Genuine self-esteem is not competitive or comparative.

***

> In human beings, joy in the mere fact of existing is a core meaning of healthy self-esteem. It is a state of one who is at war neither with self nor with others.


***
> People with high self-esteem are willing to take responsibility for what they say; therefore, they are willing to be heard; therefore, they are willing to speak clearly,



### The Need for Self-Esteem


> We are not wired so as always to choose awareness over blindness, knowledge over ignorance, fact over delusion, truth over falsehood.

**Note:** - Does self-preservation play a role in selection awareness?
- Why are we not default wired for awareness/knowledge/facts?

There is definitely a conflict against ourselves when we choose to be ignorant or unconscious of something. "Ignorance is bliss" just intentionally created blind spots of the obstacles in front of us.

- On some subconscious level are we are of our ignorance but intentionally choose to avoid it? Like some sort of internal compass telling us we're missing or misinterpreting a piece of the puzzle
    - The existence of this compass/indicator tells us whether we actually have a choice to be conscious of something. We can only make the choice when we are aware that a decision is being made and that can only happen when we *see* a fork in the road. Otherwise our perception is that we're just on a single path.

***

> But on the higher levels of consciousness, on the conceptual plane, the exercise of mind is volitional, which means it is our responsibility.
> I need to stress that it pertains specifically to situations of avoiding awareness where we perceive that clearer awareness is possible to us and decline to pursue it.

**Note:** Exercise of mind is volitional, implies that binary act of either being conscious or not-the flip of the switch, is our choice.

- The act of being conscious, being aware as being a decision

***

> Psychological determinism denies the existence of any element of freedom or volition in human consciousness. It holds that in relation to our actions, decisions, values, and conclusions, we are ultimately and essentially passive; that we are merely reactors to internal and external pressures;

***

> This means is the process of reasoning; it is thus that we validate our conclusions. But this validation is possible only if our capacity to judge is free—that is, nonconditional.

**Note:** We can validate our conclusions through reasoning -> we can validate only if we can judge freely i.e. non-conditionally

Author is stating that the ability to judge freely is the basis for our free will.
- Do we truly judge freely? Or is our judgement solely dependent on our past experience and biology

***

> The specific concept of free will being developed here differs from other theories in that it locates our freedom specifically in the choice to seek or avoid awareness.*
> ...free will entails the choice to be rational or to be irrational—which ultimately means the choice to respect reality or to defy it.


**Note:** Choice can only be made when aware of a different path. Otherwise no choice is being made.

For example, I can be caught up in my own narrative/emotions and confuse that for reality. I am only exerting free will when I'm aware that I've constructed a fake-reality and I make the choice to go along with it or not.

- Free-will being the opportunity to switch tracks, and everything else being out of our control once we've committed?
   - test


***


> We cannot exempt ourselves from the realm of values and value judgments...And to the extent that we fail to satisfy that standard, our self-respect suffers.

***

> We must act to achieve our goals—and in order to act, we must value ourselves as beneficiaries of our actions.

**Note:** - Do we ever do something that we don't benefit from directly OR indirectly?

***

> To fight for our happiness, we must consider ourselves worthy of happiness.

***

> If we betray our integrity, if we betray our moral convictions, if we turn our back on our own standards, thus undercutting our sense of worthiness, we do so by evasion...

**Note:** - We often live in conflict between our actions and words and thoughts. The conflict is essentially saying that inner-signals are wrong and therefore we must do something else

***

> But we can and do disidentify self with particular choices and operations when we say, for instance, “I regret that I chose to be so irresponsible in that matter, and I am determined to function differently in the future.”

**Note:** - Disidentification with past choices abandons the previous self. Essentially going against who you were with repulsion.

- Not healthy if you still identify with that person in other ways, thereby creating a repulsion against current parts of you

- Produces fear and distrust in your current state afraid that you will make a mistake that your future-self will similarly condemn

- Taking responsibility: "I did this with the tools and knowledge I had at that time" It would've been better if I did something else, but I cannot blame him if he didn't know and I cannot change the past. All I can do is look to my current self to make better decisions

***

> That is why change and growth are possible. We are not obliged to remain the prisoners of yesterday’s errors, or yesterday’s defaults on the responsibility of appropriate consciousness.

**Note:** appropriate consciousness is simply acknowledging the limitations that all humans have in their awareness.

- You can only be responsible when you had a choice, you only have a choice when you were consciously aware of a choice

***

> Self-concept pertains to an individual’s ideas, beliefs, and images concerning his or her (real or imagined) traits and characteristics, liabilities and assets, limitations and capabilities.

***

> When I speak of the choice to focus or not to focus, I mean seeking to expand consciousness in some way or allowing consciousness to remain at inappropriately low levels of intensity and clarity.

**Note:** - what are times where we *decide* to have low-levels of intensity/clarity  of consciousness on something? Basically deciding to be less aware of alternative path while we know it exists

Basically laziness??


### Self-Esteem and Child-Parent Relationships


> E very organism depends on its environment, to some extent, for successful growth.

***

> Let me begin with a general observation. A child needs to make sense out of his or her world, and when that need is frustrated again and again, a tragic sense of self and of life is often the result.

***

> But in choosing to deny simple reality, they give the child the impression that he exists in an incomprehensible world where perception is untrustworthy and thought is futile.

***

> One day you may be enough, but not now. You will be enough only if and when you live up to our expectations.

***

> I can free myself from the negative verdict that burdens my existence only by rejecting this very premise.

***

> “Be careful what you say to your children. They may agree with you.”

***

> the child may disown and repudiate more and more of his or her self in order to belong, to be loved, to avoid the terror of abandonment.

***

> A child has a natural desire to be seen, heard, understood, and responded to appropriately. This is the need for psychological visibility.

***

> All of us, to a profoundly important extent, experience who we are in the context of our relationships.

**Note:** - Relationships act like a mirror, we see ourselves in the way we impact the world around us

- Would we have any self-concept if we didn't impact anything around us?

***

> Our self-concept is not a single concept but a cluster of images and abstract perspectives on our various (real or imagined) traits and characteristics.

***

> ...the father is in effect permitting the boy to experience his emotions fully, to accept and integrate them into conscious awareness...He is able to assimilate the painful experience and therefore move beyond it; his natural, healthy sense of reality is now able to assert itself.

***

> A child who experiences invisibility in the early years of life and who feels badly frustrated with regard to other basic needs—physical contact, for example, or affection, or respect, or recognition, or love, or confidence in his or her strengths—is caught in a universe that is not only painful but bewildering. The child has almost no way to understand his or her suffering...
> They often lead the child to a solution that yields short-term benefits while laying the foundation for a long-term disaster in which self-esteem turns against itself.
> ...the self is attacked at one level in order to protect some sense of efficacy at another.

***

> It would be too terrifying to imagine a capricious or sadistic God. Therefore, if disaster befalls, the fault must be ours.

**Note:** - Analog to child's perspective of their parents
- Unable to to rationalize fault externally, the child reasons that it must be their fault

Similarly, to imagine a God that intentionally wishes us harm, we create reasons of why we deserve to be punished and a rationale to justify it to maintain the benevolent God

***

> The child within us, who long ago turned to self-condemnation to make sense out of the world and to survive, can have great difficulty, even now, relinquishing the notion of “badness.”

***

> the most courageous task life may ever ask of them is to relinquish their attachment to the vision of themselves as inadequate, unworthy, not enough.

***

> The desire to be validated, confirmed, approved of, in our being and behavior, is normal. I call such a desire irrational or pathological only when it gains such ascendancy in our hierarchy of values that we will sacrifice honesty and integrity in order to achieve it...

**Note:** - Honesty/Integrity is sacrificed only in the face of desperation
- Desperation exists when one *needs* validation/confirmation/approval. The need arises to be comfortable/hopeful/satisfied with one's existence

***

> ...the desire for visibility is not an expression of a weak or uncertain ego or of low self-esteem. On the contrary, the lower our self-esteem, the more we feel (at least in part) the need to hide...

**Note:** ...up to a point. Visibility certain feels good and makes sense for it to be a natural pursuit.

> ow self-esteem behavior corresponds to how much one is willing to sacrifice values/integrity to achieve it

***

> One of the characteristics of a self-esteem deficiency is an excessive preoccupation with gaining the approval and avoiding the disapproval of others, a hunger for validation and support at every moment of our existence.

**Note:** "at every moment" implies a constant need of validation to be comfortable. Like a bucket with a hole in it

***

> The hunger is not for visibility; it is for self-esteem. And this cannot be supplied by others...Even if the other person’s fantasies concerning us are complimentary, we feel invisible, unseen; we feel unreal to the person...

***

> The kind of decisions and conclusions we arrive at inevitably reflect the mental operations through which we process the events of our life.

***

### Generating Positive Self-Esteem...


> A commitment to awareness—the will to understand—is the central pillar of positive self-esteem
> ...the behavior of seeking to integrate, to the best of our knowledge and ability, that which enters our mental field—as well as the effort to keep expanding that field.
> ...responding to life actively rather than passively. This is the foundation of honoring the self.

***

> The child who continues to struggle to make sense out of the world and the people in it, however, is developing a powerful source of strength, no matter what the anguish or bewilderment experienced. Caught in a particularly cruel, frustrating, and irrational environment, he or she will doubtless feel alienated from many of the people in the immediately surrounding world, and legitimately so. But the child will not feel alienated from reality, will not feel, at the deepest level, incompetent to live—or at least he or she has a relatively good chance to avoid this fate.

***

> A commitment to awareness, then—a commitment to thinking as a way of life—is both a source and an expression of positive self-esteem.

***

> The concept of the will to be efficacious is an extension of the will to understand.

***

> Don’t give up the conviction that it’s possible to be in control of your life.

***

> The will to be efficacious—the refusal of a human consciousness to accept helplessness as its permanent and unalterable condition.

***

> We can feel temporarily defeated without defining our essence as failure.

***

> the choices we make concerning awareness, the honesty of our relationship to reality, the level of our personal integrity.

***

> Its context is always the individuals relationship to self and to the choices of self.

***

> One of the most important forms of heroism is the heroism of consciousness, the heroism of thought: the willingness to tolerate aloneness.

***

> Still, on many occasions we can recognize that the desire to perform some action is not proof that we should perform it:

***

> rather that there is a pronounced and evident desire and intention to see things as they are.

***

> We cannot always know for certain whether or not we are being rational or honest; but we can certainly be concerned about it, we can certainly care.

***

> The task of consciousness is to perceive that which exists, to the best of our ability. To honor reality—the perception of that which exists—is to honor consciousness; to honor consciousness is to honor the self.

***

> Integrity means the integration of convictions, standards, beliefs—and behavior.

***

> We need values to guide our actions. We need principles to guide our lives.

***

> We may accept a code of values that does violence to our needs as living organisms.

***

> the time has obviously come to question our standards, rather than simply resigning ourselves to living without integrity.

***

> Such conflicts and the manner in which they are resolved or left unresolved necessarily affect the quality of the individual’s self-esteem because they affect the experience of integrity. And integrity is a prerequisite of high self-esteem.

***

> responsible as the chief causal agent in my life and behavior.

***

> Avoiding self-responsibility victimizes us with regard to our own life; it leaves us helpless.

***

> Self-esteem is rooted internally, rather than in external successes or failures.

***

> We always contain within ourselves the possibility of change; we need never be the prisoner of yesterday’s choices.

***

> To be self-accepting does not mean to be without a wish to change, improve, evolve. It means not to be at war with ourselves—not to deny the reality of what is true of us right now, at this moment of our existence.

***

> To accept ourselves is to accept the fact that what we think, feel, and do are all expressions of the self at the time they occur.

***

> We can note here the two fallacies already mentioned: the belief that if we accept who and what we are, we must approve of everything about us, and the belief that if we accept who and what we are, we are indifferent to change or improvement.

***

> If I can accept that I am who I am, that I feel what I feel, that I have done what I have done—if I can accept it whether I like all of it or not—then I can accept myself. I can accept my shortcomings, my self-doubts, my poor self-esteem. And when I can accept all that, I have put myself on the side of reality rather than attempting to fight reality.

***

### The Problem of Guilt


> Guilt always carries the implication of choice and responsibility, whether or not we are consciously aware of it.

***

> The point is, if we are not to corrupt the concept of responsibility, we need to keep it within rational bounds.

***

> Thus guilt serves the need for efficacy by providing an illusion of efficacy.

***

> even when one cannot say what one could have done differently, and even when decisive elements quite outside one’s personal control may have been present.

***

> This is why the protection of self-esteem requires a clear understanding of the limits of volitional responsibility. Where there is no power, there can be no responsibility, and where there is no responsibility, there can be no reasonable self-reproach. Regret, yes; guilt, no.

***

> Where there is neither evasion nor irresponsibility nor conscious breach of integrity, there are no rational grounds for the experience of guilt.

***

> independent standards to sustain and integrity to uphold.

***

> problem of “guilt” lies in the courage to heed the voice of the self—in other words, increased autonomy.

***

> It conceals the deeper problem of dependency and fear of self-assertiveness, failure to honor one’s own judgment, which means a failure to honor the self.

***

> Sometimes professions of guilt are a smoke screen for disowned feelings of resentment. I have failed to live up to someone else’s expectations or standards. I am afraid to admit that I am intimidated by those expectations and standards.

***

> In other words, when I become more honest about my own feelings—which is another form of honoring the self—I give up the need to feel “guilty.”

***

> In other words, if I tie my self-esteem to my parents’ approval and the cost of approval is compliance, then I end up pursuing positive self-esteem by accepting negative self-esteem.

***

> The solution, in principle, again lies in increasing autonomy, shifting the sources of self-esteem from external signals to internal signals, from the parents’ judgment to the client’s judgment—which means, again, learning to honor the self.

***

> We do not transcend by denying or repressing our feelings of dependence, but rather by accepting them, experiencing them, and then stepping beyond them by learning to listen to and respect our internal signals—to

***

> Thus, a person declares: “I feel guilty for desiring my best friend’s wife.” Implication: Our sexual desires are under our direct volitional control and should never flow in an inconvenient or inappropriate direction.

***

> There is a paradox in the acceptance of unearned guilt. Very often the result is the creation of real guilt.

***

> Just as courage may be needed in order for a person to be truthful about feelings of resentment, so too may it be needed before he or she can admit to feelings of pride and happiness.

***

> If we attempt to avoid, disown, and repress our negative feelings, rather than deal with them honestly, all we succeed in doing is driving them underground, and then guilt spreads and diffuses through the entire sense of self.

***

> Action is essential. If we take actions that have damaged our self-esteem, then only by taking the appropriate counteractions can we repair our self-esteem.

***

> We deceive ourselves if we imagine that we can redeem our self-esteem merely by suffering—or

***

> T o the extent that a person suffers from poor self-esteem, his or her consciousness is ruled by fear: fear of other people, fear of the real or imagined facts about the self that have been evaded or repressed. There is fear of the external world and fear of the internal world.


### Motivation by Fear


> There is no way to preserve the clarity of our thinking so long as there are considerations in our mind, chiefly governed by fear, that take precedence over the knowable facts of reality.

***

> that positive self-esteem is intimately related to honesty and integrity.

***

> any time we are willing to tolerate temporary fear or anxiety on the path to better contact with reality, our self-esteem increases.

***

> Anxiety in general is a psychological alarm signal warning of real or imagined danger to the organism.

***

> In the case of self-esteem anxiety, the thing of value being threatened, ultimately, is the sufferer’s ego.

***

> Anything that threatens to collapse the sense of personal worth is a source of self-esteem anxiety.

***

> This is the vast, anonymous assemblage of men and women who have accepted fear as a built-in, not-to-be-wondered-about fixture of their soul, often dreading even to identify that what they feel is fear or to inquire into the nature of that which they seek to escape.

***

> Such anxiety is a response to an unconsciously perceived threat to self-esteem—to the sense of control, efficacy, and worth.

***

> It implies that “to be” is to be in danger—beyond

***

> We are left with self-distrust: the implicit knowledge that mind, judgment, convictions are expendable under emotional pressure.

***

> In every instance of self-esteem anxiety, we will find a conflict in the form of “I must/should have” versus “I cannot/did not,” or “I must not” versus “I do/did/will.” There is always a conflict between, on the one hand, some value imperative that is tied, in a crucial and profound way, to the person’s self-appraisal and inner equilibrium,

***

> This complex process of self-deception, this misguided attempt at self-healing on which an individual may build his or her life, holds the key to the individual’s motivation, values, and goals—to the impulses that drive the individual along a particular path.

***

> Positive self-esteem is based on the determination to know and to act in accordance with the facts of reality as perceived and understood.

***

> pretense at self-confidence and self-respect is purchased at the price of avoidance.

***

> And in human relationships, such a person seeks, not admiration, but, more commonly, an escape from moral values, an escape from standards, a promise to be forgiven, or to be accepted without being respected, or to be admired without being understood—to

***

> Motivation by confidence, which places its primary emphasis on the possibility of enjoyment, versus motivation by terror, which places its primary emphasis on the avoidance of pain.

***

> not of dealing with it rationally, not of working to remove it, but of seeking to become persuaded that it does not exist.

***

> If an individual took responsibility for every one of his or her actions in the moment of performing the action, not only would defense values of this kind be impossible, but a radical elevation of self-esteem would be inevitable.

***

> More broadly, to the extent that we are able to step back from any of our defense values and ask ourselves, “Does this really make me good? Why do I think so?” we have the power to move toward placing our self-esteem on a saner

***

> We can accept fear and then rise above it by taking unfamiliar but desirable risks in the service of our mind and life; we need not remain trapped at the level of poor self-esteem.

***

> human inclination to follow the path of least resistance, the inclination to accept, not the right solution, but the one that appears easiest and least demanding.

***

> the burden of identity and responsibility.

***

> These are all antianxiety devices. They are all engaged for the purpose of coping with the problem of the human need for self-esteem, but in self-destructive ways.

***

> This, perhaps, is the ultimate question all of us must face: Who am I, naked and alone, with only my mind and my being and with none of the external supports


### Self-Esteem, Work, and Love


> The higher the level of our self-esteem, the more likely it is that we will find a work and a love through which we can express ourselves in satisfying and enriching ways.

***

> A sense of metaphysical efficacy imparts a confidence in the ability in principle to learn whatever is necessary.

***

> I want to stress once again that productive achievement is a consequence and expression of high self-esteem, not its primary cause.

***

> One of the forms of psychological heroism is the willingness to tolerate anxiety and uncertainty in the pursuit of our values—whether those values be work goals, the love of another human being, the raising of a family, or personal growth.

***

> To accept the process of struggle as part of life, to accept all of it, even the darkest moments of anguish (which is motivation by love rather than motivation by fear, motivation by confidence rather than motivation by insecurity)—that

***

> The wish to avoid fear and pain is not the motive that drives the lives of highly evolved men and women.

***

> In the area of self-esteem and love, there is a powerful tendency for like to be attracted to like.

***

> I see other people essentially as sources of approval or disapproval, not as people in their own right.

***

> not deserve happiness, are not entitled to happiness, have no right to the fulfillment of their emotional needs and wants.

***

> The success of love relationships requires an appreciation of the fact that happiness is our human birthright.

* The Romantic Love Question & Answer Book, my coauthor, E. Devers Branden,

***

> The more insecure or self-doubting we are, the more likely we are to turn any disappointment, any defeat, any failure to get what we want into evidence of our incompetence, inadequacy, and unworthiness.


## II The Struggle for Individuation


### Evolving Toward Autonomy


> During the process of individuation, we become more and more completely that which we are potentially—expanding the boundaries of the self to embrace all of our potentialities,

***

> The more appropriately our needs are met at a particular stage, the more prepared we are for the next stage.

***

> We use these attainments to transcend them.
> each stage of development, entails movement toward greater autonomy.

***

> common a failure to negotiate successfully a stage of childhood development, which obstructed evolution toward adult sexuality.

***

> Emotionally mature, autonomous individuals understand that other people do not exist merely to satisfy their needs.

***

> The source of approval resides within the self. It is not at the mercy of every encounter with another person.

***

> In the best of relationships, there are occasional frictions and unavoidable hurts. The tendency of poorly individuated, immature individuals is to translate such minor incidents into major evidence of rejection.

***

> They have no confidence that what they are, without their facades and manipulations, is enough.

***

> ultimate manifestation of maturity is evidenced by the ability to think in principles about oneself.

***

> For a man to feel responsible for his actions, he must sense that the behavior has flowed from “the self.”

***

> We are taught very early to respect external signals above internal signals, to respect the voice of others above the voice of self.

***

> What makes this state of affairs particularly unfortunate is that schools represent priceless opportunities to undo or at least counteract a child’s negative experiences at home. Teachers have a unique opportunity to offer the child an alternative view of self and the world, to give a child the experience of having his or her feelings, dignity, and mind respected,

***

> Adults do possess greater knowledge than children. The question is, How is this knowledge to be transmitted?

***

> No one who is terrified of making mistakes can attain moral autonomy.

***

> to honor our internal signals to that extent—is to practice the ultimate form of intellectual independence,

***

> When the price of harmony with others becomes the surrender of our mind, an autonomous individual chooses not to pay it.

***

> So: fear of autonomy entails fear of self-responsibility entails fear of identity entails fear of aloneness entails fear of death.


### The Problem of Self-Alienation


> blindness concerning important aspects of self leads to a blindness concerning important aspects of the environment.

***

> Awareness moves freely in both directions—or it moves freely in neither.

***

> We have less access to our inner signals, and consequently we become more dependent on signals from others.

***

> Perhaps the child becomes ill and then begins to hate the body as a source of suffering and betrayal.

***

> Autonomy begins with the body. The first voice of the authentic self is the voice of the body.

***

> “On the one hand, I am more than my body; on the other, my body is me, a part of me, a manifestation and expression of me.

***

> Unblocking the body—unblocking feelings—is unblocking consciousness.

***

> No matter how much we may value autonomy intellectually, the degree to which we can achieve it is intimately related to the degree of integration among our mind, emotions, and body. Autonomy is more than cerebral. It involves our entire being.

***

> To cease to know what we feel is to cease to experience what things mean to us, which is to be cut off from our own context.

***

> possibility of integrating that which previously had been driven underground and sealed off from conscious awareness. The past thus begins to lose its hold over the present. Otherwise, we remain prisoners of that which we do not confront.

***

> Whenever there is loss, at any age, there is a psychological need for mourning, a period during which we allow ourselves to feel our pain, reflecting on what is gone from our life and how we are affected by the absence.

***

> We cannot liberate ourselves from that which we have never experienced; we cannot leave a place we have never been.

***

> But often people dismiss their longings, telling themselves that fulfillment is impossible, when in fact nothing stands in the way except the rigidity of their own thinking or their fear of family or social disapproval.

***

> If we do not learn to listen to ourselves, to respect our inner signals, if we are too quick to assume self-sacrifice as a necessity, we miss opportunities for growth and enrichment.

***

> Feelings are often the first form in which we become aware that something is wrong with our life.

***

> if we cannot feel deeply, it is very difficult to think clearly.

***

> Creativity and psychological-spiritual growth have this in common: both require times of aloneness, of silence, of meditation or contemplation, so that inner signals can be heard and allowed to reach explicit awareness,

***

> The essence of the disowning process is that the self is at war with the self—or, more precisely, that the ego sets inappropriate boundaries concerning where self ends and the not-self begins.

***

> An excellent introduction to this subject may be found in Listening to the Body by Robert Masters and Jean Houston.


### The Art of Being


> T he art of being is the art of knowing ourselves, of accepting and existing in harmony with ourselves, and of living out, in action, the highest possibilities of our nature.

***

> When we are aware of and experience our unwanted feelings, they diminish. The opposite happens with wanted feelings: they grow stronger.

***

> when I shifted from reality into the realm of “if” and “might,” he felt a freedom that gave him access to the appropriate answer.

***

> To grow up is to assume responsibility for parenting the child within.

***

> The difficulty in speaking openly is caused, not by the desire for approval as such, but by resistance to that desire.

***

> We can better practice self-acceptance when we understand that it is not unwanted feelings that impair healthy functioning but the denial and disowning of those feelings.

***

> Evasion and repression are, by their very nature, antiintegrative processes.

***

> reason is the power of integration made explicit and self-conscious;

***

> Every act of self-assertion is an implicit affirmation of my right to exist. It implies that I am not the property of others


### Death Anxiety


> And when I finally do approach the end, when I can no longer evade the fact of my mortality, I cry out, “Wait! It’s not fair! I’m not ready! I haven’t lived yet! When my life was happening, I wasn’t there!”

***

> But the consequence of doing so is a change in the client’s values and priorities in life, a greater willingness to participate in life.

***

> The glory of life is inseparable from the fact that it is finite.

***

> To be heroic is to persevere. To love the process and the struggle. To laugh without restraint and to weep without restraint.


## III Egoism


### Rational Selfishness


> “Do I have a right to honor my own needs and wants, to act on my own judgment, to strive for my own happiness?”

***

> Most people do not, of course, attempt to practice the doctrine of altruism consistently in their everyday lives. It is not a code to live by—only to die by.

***

> And being born with no innate knowledge of what is true or false, we can have no innate knowledge of what is good for us or evil. We have no automatic means of survival.

***

> We must discover the principles of action required to guide us in dealing with nature and with other human beings.* Our need for these principles is our need for a code of values.

***

> Life, for a human being, is a constant process of thought, of motion, of purpose, of achievement; it is not the state of merely not being dead.

***

> Morality is a practical, selfish necessity.

***

> Happiness is an achievement that demands an understanding of, a respect for, and a nurturing of the life process.

***

> Rational medicine can never consist of asking an individual to act against the well-being of his or her body. Rational ethics can never consist of asking an individual to act against the well-being of his or her person.

***

> It is the self that altruism implicitly regards as evil, since selflessness is its moral ideal; it is an antiself ethics.

***

> To suggest that love is selfless is to maintain that it is not in my self-interest to find a person whom I can admire, delight in, find pleasure with.

***

> This is the great compliment of love: to declare to another human being that his or her happiness is of selfish importance to ourselves.

***

> But if, too often, I ignore my own needs and wants in order to please you, I commit a crime against both of us—against myself, because of the treason to my own values, against you, because I allow you to become someone I will resent.


### Self-Sacrifice


> In traditional moral terms, however, the message of the cross is unequivocal: the nobility of the sacrifice of the higher to the lower.

> to herd people into the pen of self-sacrifice under the threat that sacrificing others to themselves is the only alternative. In the perpetuation of this fraud, religious leaders and political leaders have reinforced each other through many centuries.


### Individualism and the Free Society


> It is at the mind that every gun is aimed.

***

> communists, socialists, fascists, welfare statists—are unanimous in their belief that they have a right to dispose of the lives, property, and future of others, that private ownership of the means of production is a selfish evil, that the more a person has achieved, the greater is his or her debt to those who have not achieved it,

***

> In denying human beings freedom of thought and action, statists and collectivist systems are anti-self-esteem by their very nature.

### Self-Esteem and Beyond


> The chief thrust of Maslow’s own work was the further development of his vision of the “self-actualized personality.” In the last years of his life, however, he predicted a psychology that would be “transpersonal, transhuman, centered in the cosmos rather than in human needs

***

> a psychology that purports in any sense to be about human beings and yet to be centered, not on human beings, but on the cosmos, is a contradiction in terms.

***

> It may be reasonable to speak of an expanded sense of identity, but not of going beyond identity.

***

> The self is that which transcends, not that which is transcended.

***

> It is reasonable to talk about transcending an overrestricted concept of ego, but not reasonable to talk about transcending ego.

***

> A person who enjoys a high level of self-esteem is not normally preoccupied with thoughts of how wonderful he or she is.

***

> boundaries of self may seem to have melted at the level of immediate feeling. But this hardly means that self has been transcended or ego annihilated. It merely means that life consists of more than self-contemplation.

***

> narcissism (in its negative meaning) being a condition of unhealthy and excessive self-absorption arising from a deep-rooted sense of inner deficiency or deprivation.

***

> Love that is not self-expression and self-assertion is a contradiction in terms.

***

> we are not compelled to believe that reality is ultimately constituted by either matter or by consciousness.

***

> the ultimate enlightenment they celebrate, may be the experience of consciousness somehow accessing its source, that ultimate, underlying reality of which it is a manifestation.

***

> as long as there is awareness, even at the highest level imaginable, there is

***

> After all our self-concepts have been transcended and all our attachments relinquished, as long as we exist as conscious beings in any sense whatever, and with any view of the ultimate nature of reality, the “I” who is conscious remains—which does not deny that, as the individual evolves to higher and higher stages, the internal experience of “I” is transformed.

***

> Self-alienation impoverishes our capacity for empathy; and in dehumanizing ourselves, we inevitably dehumanize others. In failing to develop an independent and strong ego, to evolve to moral sovereignty, we become capable of unspeakable atrocities, since we do not experience ourselves as responsible for our actions.

> the value of selfless service lies not so much in the help given to the beneficiaries as in liberation from ego on the part of the one who serves.
