Tagging in the moment is much faster than tagging after the fact, and once your highlights have keywords and categories, they're much easier to review and reference. Simply highlight a passage and add a note beginning with a period (.) followed by a single word or abbreviation (with no spaces). You can also train Readwise to interpret shorthand!

In addition to the general purpose methods for mastering a passive highlight in Readwise (cloze deletion and question & answer), there's also a special active recall method called term. If you pay attention, much of any nonfiction book is spent \"coming to terms\" in which the author carefully explains what he or she means by specific words. Sometimes authors even introduces new terms. For example, the term antifragile in Nassim Taleb's Antifragile. If you master the terms in a nonfiction book, your understanding will skyrocket compared to a passive reading. To convert a highlight to a term, hit the Master icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m). ",

Then type your question to your future self ending with a question mark followed by the answer. When this highlight is resurfaced in Readwise, it will be in the form of a question.

With cloze deletion, a salient keyword is hidden from the passage, giving you an opportunity to pause and actively recall the missing information. This might sound trivial, but the simple act forces you to focus on the surrounding context and search your mind.

Active recall (also known as quizzing, testing, or retrieval) is the process by which we challenge our minds to retrieve a piece of information. Simply rereading a passage from time to time, on the other hand, is passive. Rereading is no doubt better than never revisiting the passage, but research has repeatedly shown that active recall is significantly more effective. So how can you take advantage of active recall in Readwise? For any highlight that you wish to deliberately commit to memory, hit the Master icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m). You can then convert that highlight from a passive passage to be reread to a flashcard to be actively recalled. In turn, you'll retain vastly more of what you read.",

Some highlights are hard to remember; some are easy.\n\nYou can take control of this algorithm by supplying feedback in the web app. If a highlight is better than average, especially relevant, or difficult, instruct Readwise \"More\" (keyboard shortcut 2). You'll see this highlight more often than average. If a highlight is in the middle, instruct Readwise \"Later\" (keyboard shortcut 3). You get the idea.

For those of you who prefer numbers: If you start with a portfolio worth $100 and lose 50%, you now need to earn 100% to breakeven.\nThis principle, of course, also extends to learning.",
