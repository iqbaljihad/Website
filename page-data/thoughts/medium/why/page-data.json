I want it to be available to me to sip and digest, mix &amp; match, and reference back to for many years.</p><p>I love learning and this makes the learning process that much more enjoyable and effective by allowing me present it beautifully and come back to it.</p><h3>Secondly, I won’t get everything right.</h3><p>As I start my blogging journey on things I’ve learned and felt, I will <strong>not </strong>get everything right. But unless I express it and open it up to criticism and feedback, I can never learn. An exercise in vulnerability, but also an act of bravery.</p><p>“Those who never failed, never tried” — Me (i think).</p><h3>Finally, I want to use this to engage my important people.</h3><p>At some point, I want to create a subscription option to allow people who care about my thoughts and findings to engage me. Nothing is more beautiful when ideas and perspective are shared into a beautiful melting pot that can be enjoyed by everyone and the sum being better than its parts.</p><p>In the short term, we’ll have to make do without any notifications.</p><p>Thank you, I’m looking forward to this journey!</p><p>Jihad Iqbal</p><img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d01fc89cd0e0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">","title":"Why"}},"pageContext":{"url":"/thoughts/medium/why/"}}}
