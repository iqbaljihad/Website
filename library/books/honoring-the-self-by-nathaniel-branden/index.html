Self-Esteem</h2><h3 id="self-esteem-in-human-life">Self-Esteem in Human Life</h3><pre><code>Summary just testing the summary
</code></pre><blockquote><p>High self-esteem can best be understood as the integrated sum of self-confidence and self-respect.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>High self-esteem seeks the stimulation of demanding goals.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Low self-esteem typically seeks the safety of the familiar and undemanding.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>And if I feel lovable and deserving of respect, I treat others well and expect them to treat me well. But if I feel unlovable and undeserving of respect and I am treated poorly, I put up with it and feel it is my fate.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Genuine self-esteem is not competitive or comparative.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>In human beings, joy in the mere fact of existing is a core meaning of healthy self-esteem. It is a state of one who is at war neither with self nor with others.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>People with high self-esteem are willing to take responsibility for what they say; therefore, they are willing to be heard; therefore, they are willing to speak clearly,</p></blockquote><h3 id="the-need-for-self-esteem">The Need for Self-Esteem</h3><blockquote><p>We are not wired so as always to choose awareness over blindness, knowledge over ignorance, fact over delusion, truth over falsehood.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> - Does self-preservation play a role in selection awareness?</p><ul><li>Why are we not default wired for awareness/knowledge/facts?</li></ul><p>There is definitely a conflict against ourselves when we choose to be ignorant or unconscious of something. &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot; just intentionally created blind spots of the obstacles in front of us.</p><ul><li>On some subconscious level are we are of our ignorance but intentionally choose to avoid it? Like some sort of internal compass telling us we&#x27;re missing or misinterpreting a piece of the puzzle<ul><li>The existence of this compass/indicator tells us whether we actually have a choice to be conscious of something. We can only make the choice when we are aware that a decision is being made and that can only happen when we <em>see</em> a fork in the road. Otherwise our perception is that we&#x27;re just on a single path.</li></ul></li></ul><hr/><blockquote><p>But on the higher levels of consciousness, on the conceptual plane, the exercise of mind is volitional, which means it is our responsibility.
I need to stress that it pertains specifically to situations of avoiding awareness where we perceive that clearer awareness is possible to us and decline to pursue it.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Exercise of mind is volitional, implies that binary act of either being conscious or not-the flip of the switch, is our choice.</p><ul><li>The act of being conscious, being aware as being a decision</li></ul><hr/><blockquote><p>Psychological determinism denies the existence of any element of freedom or volition in human consciousness. It holds that in relation to our actions, decisions, values, and conclusions, we are ultimately and essentially passive; that we are merely reactors to internal and external pressures;</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>This means is the process of reasoning; it is thus that we validate our conclusions. But this validation is possible only if our capacity to judge is free—that is, nonconditional.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> We can validate our conclusions through reasoning -&gt; we can validate only if we can judge freely i.e. non-conditionally</p><p>Author is stating that the ability to judge freely is the basis for our free will.</p><ul><li>Do we truly judge freely? Or is our judgement solely dependent on our past experience and biology</li></ul><hr/><blockquote><p>The specific concept of free will being developed here differs from other theories in that it locates our freedom specifically in the choice to seek or avoid awareness.*
...free will entails the choice to be rational or to be irrational—which ultimately means the choice to respect reality or to defy it.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> Choice can only be made when aware of a different path. Otherwise no choice is being made.</p><p>For example, I can be caught up in my own narrative/emotions and confuse that for reality. I am only exerting free will when I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;ve constructed a fake-reality and I make the choice to go along with it or not.</p><ul><li>Free-will being the opportunity to switch tracks, and everything else being out of our control once we&#x27;ve committed?<ul><li>test</li></ul></li></ul><hr/><blockquote><p>We cannot exempt ourselves from the realm of values and value judgments...And to the extent that we fail to satisfy that standard, our self-respect suffers.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>We must act to achieve our goals—and in order to act, we must value ourselves as beneficiaries of our actions.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> - Do we ever do something that we don&#x27;t benefit from directly OR indirectly?</p><hr/><blockquote><p>To fight for our happiness, we must consider ourselves worthy of happiness.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>If we betray our integrity, if we betray our moral convictions, if we turn our back on our own standards, thus undercutting our sense of worthiness, we do so by evasion...</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> - We often live in conflict between our actions and words and thoughts. The conflict is essentially saying that inner-signals are wrong and therefore we must do something else</p><hr/><blockquote><p>But we can and do disidentify self with particular choices and operations when we say, for instance, “I regret that I chose to be so irresponsible in that matter, and I am determined to function differently in the future.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> - Disidentification with past choices abandons the previous self. Essentially going against who you were with repulsion.</p><ul><li><p>Not healthy if you still identify with that person in other ways, thereby creating a repulsion against current parts of you</p></li><li><p>Produces fear and distrust in your current state afraid that you will make a mistake that your future-self will similarly condemn</p></li><li><p>Taking responsibility: &quot;I did this with the tools and knowledge I had at that time&quot; It would&#x27;ve been better if I did something else, but I cannot blame him if he didn&#x27;t know and I cannot change the past. All I can do is look to my current self to make better decisions</p></li></ul><hr/><blockquote><p>That is why change and growth are possible. We are not obliged to remain the prisoners of yesterday’s errors, or yesterday’s defaults on the responsibility of appropriate consciousness.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> appropriate consciousness is simply acknowledging the limitations that all humans have in their awareness.</p><ul><li>You can only be responsible when you had a choice, you only have a choice when you were consciously aware of a choice</li></ul><hr/><blockquote><p>Self-concept pertains to an individual’s ideas, beliefs, and images concerning his or her (real or imagined) traits and characteristics, liabilities and assets, limitations and capabilities.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>When I speak of the choice to focus or not to focus, I mean seeking to expand consciousness in some way or allowing consciousness to remain at inappropriately low levels of intensity and clarity.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> - what are times where we <em>decide</em> to have low-levels of intensity/clarity  of consciousness on something? Basically deciding to be less aware of alternative path while we know it exists</p><p>Basically laziness??</p><h3 id="self-esteem-and-child-parent-relationships">Self-Esteem and Child-Parent Relationships</h3><blockquote><p>E very organism depends on its environment, to some extent, for successful growth.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Let me begin with a general observation. A child needs to make sense out of his or her world, and when that need is frustrated again and again, a tragic sense of self and of life is often the result.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>But in choosing to deny simple reality, they give the child the impression that he exists in an incomprehensible world where perception is untrustworthy and thought is futile.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>One day you may be enough, but not now. You will be enough only if and when you live up to our expectations.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>I can free myself from the negative verdict that burdens my existence only by rejecting this very premise.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>“Be careful what you say to your children. They may agree with you.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>the child may disown and repudiate more and more of his or her self in order to belong, to be loved, to avoid the terror of abandonment.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>A child has a natural desire to be seen, heard, understood, and responded to appropriately. This is the need for psychological visibility.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>All of us, to a profoundly important extent, experience who we are in the context of our relationships.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> - Relationships act like a mirror, we see ourselves in the way we impact the world around us</p><ul><li>Would we have any self-concept if we didn&#x27;t impact anything around us?</li></ul><hr/><blockquote><p>Our self-concept is not a single concept but a cluster of images and abstract perspectives on our various (real or imagined) traits and characteristics.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>...the father is in effect permitting the boy to experience his emotions fully, to accept and integrate them into conscious awareness...He is able to assimilate the painful experience and therefore move beyond it; his natural, healthy sense of reality is now able to assert itself.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>A child who experiences invisibility in the early years of life and who feels badly frustrated with regard to other basic needs—physical contact, for example, or affection, or respect, or recognition, or love, or confidence in his or her strengths—is caught in a universe that is not only painful but bewildering. The child has almost no way to understand his or her suffering...
They often lead the child to a solution that yields short-term benefits while laying the foundation for a long-term disaster in which self-esteem turns against itself.
...the self is attacked at one level in order to protect some sense of efficacy at another.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>It would be too terrifying to imagine a capricious or sadistic God.
