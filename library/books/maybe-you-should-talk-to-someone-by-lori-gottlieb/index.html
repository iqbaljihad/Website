no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls.” But he also said this: “Who looks inside, awakes.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>We can’t have change without loss, which is why so often people say they want change but nonetheless stay exactly the same.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>hours spent surfing the internet (an activity my colleague calls “the most effective short-term nonprescription painkiller”).</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>One of the most important steps in therapy is helping people take responsibility for their current predicaments, because once they realize that they can (and must) construct their own lives, they’re free to generate change.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Sometimes we are the cause of our difficulties. And if we can step out of our own way, something astonishing happens.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>It’s more that every story has multiple threads, and they tend to leave out the strands that don’t jibe with their perspectives. Most of what patients tell me is absolutely true—from their current points of view.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Robert Frost poem: “The only way out is through.” The only way to get to the other side of the tunnel is to go through it, not around it.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Most big transformations come about from the hundreds of tiny, almost imperceptible, steps we take along the way. A lot can happen in the space of a step.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>What people don’t like to think about is that you can do everything right—in life or in a treatment protocol—and still get the short end of the stick. And when that happens, the only control you have is how you deal with that stick—your way, not the way others say you should.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Study after study shows that the most important factor in the success of your treatment is your relationship with the therapist, your experience of “feeling felt.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Yes, I’m seeking objectivity, but only because I’m convinced that objectivity will rule in my favor.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>while we aim to discover what’s not working, patients try to keep the illusion going to avoid shame—to seem more together than they really are. Both parties have the well-being of the patient in mind but often work at cross-purposes in the service of a mutual goal.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>He knows that most people are brilliant at finding ways to filter out the things they don’t want to look at, at using distractions or defenses to keep threatening feelings at bay.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Its opposite is wise compassion, which means caring about the person but also giving him or her a loving truth bomb when needed.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Neuroscientists discovered that humans have brain cells called mirror neurons that cause them to mimic others, and when people are in a heightened state of emotion, a soothing voice can calm their nervous systems and help them stay present.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>People often mistake numbness for nothingness, but numbness isn’t the absence of feelings; it’s a response to being overwhelmed by too many feelings.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>If we don’t accept the notion that there’s no redo, much as we try to get our parents or siblings or partners to fix what happened years ago, our pasts will keep us stuck. Changing our relationship to the past is a staple of therapy.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>When the present falls apart, so does the future we had associated with it.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Even so, the poet Philip Larkin put it best: “They fuck you up, your mum and dad, / They may not mean to, but they do.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>losses tend to be multilayered. There’s the actual loss (in my case, of Boyfriend), and the underlying loss (what it represents). That’s why for many people the pain of a divorce is only partially about the loss of the other person; often it’s just as much about what the change represents—failure, rejection, betrayal, the unknown,</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>It’s Wendell’s job to help me edit my story. All therapists do this: What material is extraneous? Are the supporting characters important or a distraction? Is the story advancing or is the protagonist going in circles? Do the plot points reveal a theme?</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Honesty is stronger medicine than sympathy, which may console but often conceals. —Gretel Ehrlich</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>“The cardinal rules of good parenting—moderation, empathy, and temperamental accommodation with one’s child—are</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Happiness equals reality minus expectations.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>because feelings lead to behaviors. Once we know what we’re feeling, we can make choices about where we want to go with them.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>While women feel cultural pressure to keep up their physical appearance, men feel that pressure to keep up their emotional appearance.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Einstein: “No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>freedom involves responsibility, and there’s a part of most of us that finds responsibility frightening.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Insight allows you to ask yourself, Is this something that’s being done to me or am I doing it to myself? The answer gives you choices, but it’s up to you to make them.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Follow your envy—it shows you what you want.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>men commit suicide three times more often than women)?</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>a sign of depression known as psychomotor retardation. (This slowing down of coordinated efforts between the brain and the body</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>As Andrew Solomon wrote in The Noonday Demon: “The opposite of depression isn’t happiness, but vitality.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>We marry our unfinished business.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>When you stop tossing junk into the void—words, words, and more words—something important rises to the surface.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>I’d need to accept that his future and mine, his present and mine, were now separate and that all we had left in common was our history.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>What most people mean by type is a sense of attraction—a type of physical appearance or a type of personality turns them on. But what underlies a person’s type, in fact, is a sense of familiarity.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>They have an uncanny attraction to people who share the characteristics of a parent who in some way hurt them. ... It’s not that people want to get hurt again. It’s that they want to master a situation in which they felt helpless as children.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>People don’t have to tell you their stories with words because they always act them out for you.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>“Resistance is a therapist’s friend. Don’t fight it—follow it.” In other words, try to figure out why it’s there in the first place.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Just as often, there are people who have extremely problematic relationships and fantastic sex, and there are people who are deeply in love but who don’t click with the same intensity in the bedroom.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Projective identification is like tossing a hot potato to the other person. The man no longer has to feel his anger, since it’s now living inside his partner.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>people resent being told what to do. Yes, they may have asked to be told—repeatedly, relentlessly—but after you comply, their initial relief is replaced by resentment. This happens even if things go swimmingly, because ultimately humans want to have agency over their lives,</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>alexithymia. She doesn’t know what she’s feeling or doesn’t have the words to express it.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>The psychoanalyst Erich Fromm had made this point more than fifty years earlier: “Modern man thinks he loses something—time—when he does not do things quickly; yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains except kill it.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>The second people felt alone, I noticed, usually in the space between things—leaving a therapy session, at a red light, standing in a checkout line, riding the elevator—they picked up devices and ran away from that feeling. In a state of perpetual distraction, they seemed to be losing the ability to be with others and losing their ability to be with themselves.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>“a relentless need to escape a moment that never ends.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>self-sabotage as a form of control.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>The four ultimate concerns are death, isolation, freedom, and meaninglessness.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Like many people my age, I don’t feel free because I’ve lost touch with that emotional freedom. And that’s what I’m doing here in therapy—trying to free myself emotionally again.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>I can tell that John’s feeling what therapists call flooded, meaning that his nervous system is in overdrive, and when people feel flooded, it’s best to wait a beat.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>In the 1980s, a psychologist named James Prochaska developed the transtheoretical model of behavior change (TTM) based on research showing that people generally don’t “just do it,” as Nike (or a new year’s resolution) might have it, but instead tend to move through a series of sequential stages that look like this: Stage 1: Pre-contemplation Stage 2: Contemplation Stage 3: Preparation Stage 4: Action Stage 5: Maintenance</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>We can’t convince people not to be self-destructive, because for now, the self-destruction serves them. What we can do is try to help them understand themselves better and show them how to ask themselves the right questions until something happens—either internally or externally—that leads them to do their own persuading.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>people procrastinate or self-sabotage as a way to stave off change—even positive change—because they’re reluctant to give something up without knowing what they’ll get in its place.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>people need to do the same thing over and over a seemingly ridiculous number of times before they’re ready to change.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>After all of her efforts to try to get these men to love her the way she wants to be loved, she can’t change them because they don’t want to change.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>Erikson’s psychosocial stages focus on personality development in a social context (such as how infants develop a sense of trust in others). Most important, Erikson’s stages continue throughout the entire lifespan, and each interrelated stage involves a crisis that we need to get through to move on to the next.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>She was used to viewing the world from a place of deficit, and as a result, joy felt foreign to her. If you’re used to feeling abandoned, if you already know what it’s like for people to disappoint or reject you—well, it may not feel good, but at least there are no surprises;</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>They strive to give their children all the things they themselves didn’t have, but they sometimes end up, without even realizing it, resenting the kids for their good fortune.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>You can have compassion without forgiving. There are many ways to move on, and pretending to feel a certain way isn’t one of them.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>We may want others’ forgiveness, but that comes from a place of self-gratification; we are asking forgiveness of others to avoid the harder work of forgiving ourselves.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>pain can be protective; staying in a depressed place can be a form of avoidance. Safe inside her shell of pain, she doesn’t have to face anything, nor does she have to emerge into the world, where she might get hurt again. Her inner critic serves her: I don’t have to take any action because I’m worthless.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>A flight to health is a phenomenon in which patients convince themselves that they’re suddenly over their issues because, unbeknownst to them, they can’t tolerate the anxiety that working through these issues is bringing up.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>being a fulfilled adult means taking responsibility for the course of your own life and accepting the fact that now you’re in charge of your choices. You have to move to the front seat and be the mommy dog driving the car.”</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>but the stages of change are such that you don’t drop all of your defenses at the same time. Instead, you release them in layers, moving closer and closer to the tender core: your sadness, your shame.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>You can’t get through your pain by diminishing it, he reminded me. You get through your pain by accepting it and figuring out what to do with it. You can’t change what you’re denying or minimizing.</p></blockquote><hr/><blockquote><p>idea behind them is that if patients believe that a behavior or symptom is beyond their control, then making it voluntary, something they can choose whether or not to do, calls that belief into question.
